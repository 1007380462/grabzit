{"name":"Grabzit","tagline":"GrabzIt enables you to take web screenshots in a variety of programming languages and formats. Or convert online videos to animated GIF's or HTML tables to spreadsheets.","body":"Turn Websites into Screenshots!\r\n===============================\r\nGrabzIt aspires to allow any programming language no matter how basic to turn a website into Image, PDF and table screenshots.\r\n\r\nTo do this we provide client libraries that allow a language to send a request to make a screenshot, to our server that then sends the callback with the completed screenshot.\r\n\r\nWhile we currently support [ASP.NET](http://grabz.it/api/aspnet/), [Java](http://grabz.it/api/java/), [Javascript](http://grabz.it/api/javascript/), [Node.js](http://grabz.it/api/nodejs/), [PHP](http://grabz.it/api/php/), [Perl](http://grabz.it/api/perl/), [Python](http://grabz.it/api/python/) and [Ruby](http://grabz.it/api/ruby/) we aim to create a library for as many programming languages as possible. If you would like to help us achieve this please do!\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\n\r\nWe have made the programming libraries as simple as possible to use. To create a screenshot you must first call the SetImageOptions method followed by the Save method. You will need a application key and application secret, you can get these from [http://grabz.it](http://grabz.it).\r\n\r\n```\r\ninclude(\"GrabzItClient.class.php\");\r\n\r\n//Create the GrabzItClient class\r\n//Replace \"APPLICATION KEY\", \"APPLICATION SECRET\" with the values from your account!\r\n$grabzIt = new GrabzItClient(\"APPLICATION KEY\", \"APPLICATION SECRET\");\r\n//Take the picture the method will return the unique identifier assigned to this task\r\n$grabzIt->SetImageOptions(\"http://www.google.com\");\r\n$id = $grabzIt->Save(\"http://www.example.com/handler.php\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that in the above example the location of the handler.php is defined this is used to handle the call back when the screenshot service has completed taking the screenshot.\r\n\r\nThe handler that accepts the call back and saves the image is below.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninclude(\"GrabzItClient.class.php\");\r\n\r\n$message = $_GET[\"message\"];\r\n$customId = $_GET[\"customid\"];\r\n$id = $_GET[\"id\"];\r\n$filename = $_GET[\"filename\"];\r\n$format = $_GET[\"format\"];\r\n\r\n//Custom id can be used to store user ids or whatever is needed for the later processing of the\r\n//resulting screenshot\r\n\r\n$grabzIt = new GrabzItClient(\"APPLICATION KEY\", \"APPLICATION SECRET\");\r\n$result = $grabzIt->GetResult($id);\r\n\r\nif (!$result)\r\n{\r\n\treturn;\r\n}\r\n\r\n//Ensure that the application has the correct rights for this directory.\r\nfile_put_contents(\"results\" . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $filename, $result);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that's it! Your website should now be taking screenshots!\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nFor further more in depth documentation go to [http://grabz.it/api](http://grabz.it/api).\r\n","google":"UA-7283715-9","note":"Don't delete this file!
