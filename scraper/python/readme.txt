GrabzIt Scraper 1.0
===================

This library enables you to process scraped data and integrate it into your own application.

Its usually best to place these package files in their own directory.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ For your application to be reachable by GrabzIt it must first be deployed to a publicly accessible web server.+
